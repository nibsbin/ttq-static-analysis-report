Based on the "SPOTLITE MobSF report_3Jul25.pdf," here is a detailed breakdown of the sections and layout designed to help you reproduce this document as a template.

### **Document Overview**

The document is a static analysis security report generated by the Mobile Security Framework (MobSF). It follows a strict hierarchical layout: **Executive Summary  Technical Metadata  Security Checks (Binary/Code)  Network Analysis  Reconnaissance  Logs.**

The layout relies heavily on **data tables** with specific column headers, interspersed with **Key-Value metadata blocks**.

---

### **1. Header and Scorecard (Page 1-2)**

This section acts as the executive summary.

* 
**Visual Header:** A large branding banner ("MobSF") and the target application's icon.


* **Key Metadata Block:** Located at the top right, listing:
* File Name, Identifier, Scan Date.




* **Security Scorecard:**
* 
**App Security Score:** A prominent numerical score (e.g., 44/100) with a risk rating (e.g., MEDIUM RISK).


* **Findings Severity Table:** A matrix summary of issues categorized by severity.
* 
*Columns:* User-defined categories (High, Medium, Info, Secure, Hotspot).


* *Rows:* Count of issues per category.





### **2. Technical Specifications (Page 2-3)**

This section defines exactly what was scanned. It consists of three distinct data blocks:

* 
**File Information:** Lists technical file attributes including File Name, Size, MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes.


* 
**App Information:** Lists App Name, App Type (e.g., Swift), and Identifier.


* 
**Build & Platform Information:** Lists SDK Name, Version, Build number, Platform Version, Min OS Version, and Supported Platforms.


* 
**Binary Information:** Lists Architecture (ARM64), Sub Arch, Bit (64-bit), and Endianness.



### **3. Primary Binary Analysis (Page 3-4)**

This section analyzes the main application executable.

* **IPA Binary Code Analysis:** A table identifying specific dangerous functions or API usage.
* 
*Columns:* No, Issue, Severity, Standards (CWE/OWASP), Description.




* **IPA Binary Analysis (Security Features):** A table checking for compiler-level security protections.
* 
*Columns:* Protection (e.g., NX, PIE, Stack Canary), Status (True/False), Severity, Description.





### **4. Dependency Analysis (Pages 4-39)**

This is the longest section of the report. It uses a **repeating table format** to analyze every Dynamic Library (`.dylib`) and Framework embedded in the app.

* **Structure:** A wide data table that spans many pages.
* **Columns:**
1. 
**NO:** Index number.


2. 
**DYLIB/FRAMEWORK:** The file path (e.g., `Frameworks/libswiftCore.dylib`).


3. 
**NX:** (Non-Executable bit status).


4. 
**STACK CANARY:** (Buffer overflow protection status).


5. 
**ARC:** (Automatic Reference Counting status).


6. 
**RPATH:** (Runpath Search Path status).


7. 
**CODE SIGNATURE:** (Signature verification status).


8. 
**ENCRYPTED:** (Binary encryption status).


9. 
**SYMBOLS STRIPPED:** (Debug symbol status).




* 
**Visual Indicators:** The "Severity" (Info, Warning, High) is often listed inside the cell text alongside the True/False status.



### **5. Network & Domain Analysis (Pages 39-42)**

This section analyzes external connections and geographic data.

* 
**OFAC Sanctioned Countries:** A warning block if the app communicates with sanctioned regions.


* **Domain Malware Check:** A detailed table analyzing every domain the app contacts.
* *Columns:*
* 
**DOMAIN:** The URL (e.g., `api.flutter.dev`).


* 
**STATUS:** Operational status (e.g., "ok").


* 
**GEOLOCATION:** Nested data including IP address, Country, Region, City, Latitude/Longitude, and a "View Google Map" link.







### **6. Data Reconnaissance (Pages 42-43)**

A section dedicated to extracting hardcoded sensitive data.

* **Emails:** A table listing email addresses found within the binary files.
* 
*Columns:* Email, File (the specific framework or binary where the email was found).





### **7. Audit Trail / Scan Logs (Pages 43-47)**

A chronological log of the analysis process.

* **Table Format:**
* 
**Timestamp:** Date and time of the event.


* 
**Event:** Description of the action (e.g., "Unzipping", "Analyzing Payload...").


* 
**Error:** Status check (usually "OK").





### **8. Footer (Page 47)**

* Contains the generation signature: "Report Generated by - MobSF [Version]" and copyright information.

### **Template Styling Notes**

* **Color Coding:** The report uses color text to denote risk.
* 
**High (Red):** Critical security flaws (e.g., Missing Stack Canary).


* 
**Warning (Orange):** Potential issues (e.g., Symbols not stripped).


* 
**Info (Green/Blue):** Security features present (e.g., ARC True).




* **Fonts:** The document appears to use a standard sans-serif font (likely Helvetica or Arial) for readability.
